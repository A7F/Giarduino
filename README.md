# Giarduino
Yea, I know what you are thinking to, another gardening arduino project. Things are getting boring... 

*BUT NOT TODAY.* In fact, there are a shit ton of already made projects out there but not a single one was able to fit my needings, so I decided to do a "custom" one. Here are some key points my project must feature:

1. Low cost, enough to be affordable for a student
2. Must have at least 3 watering programs
3. Fully customizable
4. Easy to use, grandma-proof

Up to now this project is still a work in progress but I really hope to finish this as soon as possible otherwise my plants will probably die... and we don't want this to happen. On the other hand I have to finish my exams, so...

## Parts and prices
First thing first, be wise *like me* and buy everything from china: you will save a lot. All the following prices are the money I spent for that component.

| Component  | Price (€) | Needed |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DHT22  | 3.00  | 1 |
| ~~*LEDs*~~  | 2.00  | 1 |
| ~~*LDR*~~  | 1.45  | 1 |
| I2C LCD  | 4.17  | 1 |
| ~~*Button*~~  | 2.50  | 1 |
| ~~*1Kohm resistors*~~  | 3.15  | 2 |
| ~~Arduino uno R3~~  | 4.29  | 1 |
| ~~*Jumpers*~~  | 3.00  | idk |
| ~~Breadboard~~  | 3.55  | 1 |
| I2C Real time clock  | 1.36  | 1 |
| Solenoid valve (9V)  | 11.00  | 1 |

Up to now I spent about 20€. All the components in italics are purchased as stock because no one will ever sell you a single LDR or button, however don't worry, those prices are referred as total.

The striked components are those I already had, this way you can compare the costs. Of course, being a wip project, I will update the table with the stuff I still have to purchase... which are not so many things, the main cost is the solenoid valve. Fuck you, valve.

### Stuff I need to purchase to finish
- [ ] Relay
- [ ] Some tubing (4-5m maybe)
- [ ] Faucets 
- [ ] Pegs
- [ ] Some wood to make the enclosure for the whole system
- [ ] 9V battery
- [ ] Screws and some electric wire for the diy soil moisture sensors

## Up to now...
Well, I still have to think about how to power my arduino. I thought to make everything self-sustainable but I have to do some calculations and, specially, I have to find out where to place a solar panel if I choose to go for this road. We all agree this choice would be the best!

I started writing the arduino sketch and I have to say it is at a fairly good progress! I would like to upload also the wiring part but is not definitive so if you are interested to, please ask: I am planning to release it when the prototype is nearly finished.
